In this experiment we will have a chance to learn  trees, a very important data structure concept, 
and manipulating of it. In computer science, a treeis a widely-used data structure that emulates a 
tree  structure  with  a  set  of  linked  nodes.  It  is  an acyclic  and  connected  graph.  Most  of  the 
literatures  also  include  the  constraint  that  a  graph's  edges  must  be  undirected  to  be  a  tree 
In this work you’re expected to implement a programthat manipulates the product/category tree 
of  amazon.com  web  site.   You’ll  be  given  two  input  files:  “urunler.txt”,  containing  a  sample 
subset  of  categories  and  products  of  amazon.com  and “islem.txt”  which  contains  some 
commands  that  will  be  executed  against  products/categories

Your program will construct this structure by reading the plain text file (urunler.txt)  given to 
you  and  make  some  operations  on  this  structure  by  reading  and  processing  the  commands  in 
“islem.txt”.  Every  command  result  must  be  outputted  to  “output.txt”.  The  filenames  are 
constant and your program mustn’t take any parameter at startup. However, no GUI is expected from you. Therefore, your only work is to read input files, process them and reflecting the results 
to output file
